# Analysis-of-endometrial-cancer-using-miRNA-expression-data

This repository contains the scripts written for the analysis of miRNA expression in endometrial cancer samples, 
the identification of target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs and the GO and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis
of identified target genes. 

The figure representing how the miRNA samples are clustered according to cancer stages after 
performing cluster analysis using t-sne, a heatmap comparing expression of the differentially expressed miRNAs in two
cancer conditions, barplots of top related GO terms and KEGG pathways of miRNAs' target genes, and an enrichment plot of
top related KEGG pathways have also been included.

For these analysis, a normalized miRNA expression dataset for endometrial cancer obtained from TCGA and the 
corresponding clinical data and sample information have been provided by the University of Tartu (Estonia).
